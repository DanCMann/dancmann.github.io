Welcome to my website! 
I'm a researcher whose work focuses on comparative vocal behavior. 
That is, what are the similarities and differences in how animals - including humans! - produce, perceive, and use sounds. 
My background is in linguistics, but I've been working in biology since 2015. 
You can find out more about my research [here](research.qmd). 

I also love data science and using computational tools to help us better understand our world. I work as a data science consultant in the [Fusani Lab](https://fusanilab.org/) and I teach statistics and R programming for the Department of Cognitive Biology at the University of Vienna.
